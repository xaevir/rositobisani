            How is the fact that water temperature stays stable a selling point?
            E 61 Group head
            Commercial thermo compensated group head with dynamic pre-infusion 
            technology for optimal espresso technology (thermo compensated group 
            head means that there is constant hot water circulation in the group 
            head to keep the temperature stable when brewing espresso. Imagine 
            the espresso machine as an entire water circuit. Cold water comes 
            in and goes through the heat exchangers where it’s heated, and then 
            circulates throughout the machine including the group head to keep 
            hot water readily available for when someone goes to pull an 
            espresso shot. All of our machines have this including the Reale. 
            See attached diagram).
          li(style="display: none").
            This machine has the same group head as the tecnica and Synchro so 
            it will make a commercial coffee shop quality espresso based on 
            everything I wrote in this paragraph.
