          | Our espresso machine needed service at 4:30pm on a Friday 
          | afternoon over the holidays during &lsquo;Grinchmas&rsquo;, our largest 
          | event of the year. Leo arrived within the hour, and not only 
          | fixed our machine, but stayed for an additional hour to make 
          | sure everything ran smoothly during our event. Now that is 
          | customer service!  <b class="quotes">&rdquo;</b>

          | In 2008 Jeff, the service manager in the East, TWICE delivered 
          | and installed espresso machines for us (with some assistance from 
          | our staff) while on crutches just 1 week after surgery to repair his 
          | torn achilles tendon. It was the night before our grand opening, and 
          | we had a shipping delay with the espresso equipment vendor we 
          | were working with at the time.  Coincidentally this happened to 
          | 2 of our locations within the same week! On both occasions, RBE 
          | acted quickly and ensured we had equipment at both locations in 
          | time for our openings. Needless to say, we have been working 
          | with these guys ever since! <b class="quotes">&rdquo;</b>

          | Working closely with RBE for equipment needs and service support 
          | has been an incredible benefit to our wholesale partners. Their 
          | knowledge and responsiveness provide great peace of mind.
