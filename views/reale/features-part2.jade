        <b>John Marta, our lead engineer</b><br />
        Our engineers only know commercial machines so when we were asked to create our first
        home unit, we made it with the same quality parts as our commercial machines.

    .explanation.
      100% of the copper and steal components are made in our manufacturing plant.
      This means copper boilers, copper connecting pipes, and steel frames are produced exactly to our
      specific requirements. This precision in manufacturing enables us to create a personal machine
      that delivers the taste of the coffee shop in your home.

      h3 Stable heat to stop sour espresso
      p.
        One of the problems many machines have is they do not have the heavy
        commercial grade internal components to keep the temperature consistent.
        If the temperature varies in the slightest from the boiler to the moment
        of extraction the result is sour espresso. To guarantee stable
        temperature through extraction we use <b>9 pounds of chrome
        plated brass</b> otherwise known as the legendary e61 group head.
        Its density and its reliance on basic physics as opposed to added
        electrical parts is what keeps the water temperature perfectly stable.
        Its the same group head used in our other commercial machines.

      h3 The Perfect shot through Pre-infusion
      p.
        Before the actual extraction of espresso, the Reale gently wets the 
        grinds which gives them a uniform density. Now when the coffee receives 
        the full pressure of the brew, the water seeps through evenly allowing 
        the most flavor and aroma to be extracted. It is the exact same method 
        used in coffee bar machines.

      h3 Steam milk without delay
      p.
        The temperature to steam milk is hotter than the temperature to extract a 
        shot so for most home units you have to wait five minutes after pulling a shot
        to steam milk, however not with the Reale. We use a dynamic boiler called a 
        heat exchanger so there is no wait time just like in the cafe.
